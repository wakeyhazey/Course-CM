# Course-CM
Computational Musicology 2022 course.

My corpus will consist of movie soundtracks. I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly which soundtracks to use. 
The goal is to atleast find 4 distinct genre's of film and compare their soundtracks to hopefully find out what differs between the soundtracks of 
those genre's.

I would expect the difference to be the sounds used, making the timbre different, and tempo, valence and danecability to vary.
